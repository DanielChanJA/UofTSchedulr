This process will lead to the preparation of project proposals consisting of identification of design objectives and constraints, generation and evaluation of potential approaches, selection of the most promising design concept, identification of product subsystems, and assignment of responsibilities to team members. Following project approval, the design process will comprise preliminary design, followed by detailed design, prototype construction and testing, and preparation of a final design report. Progress is evaluated weekly, culminating in a prototype demonstration and design review.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Division of Engineering Science","prerequisites":"","exclusions":"","level":200,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2017 Winter","meeting_sections":[{"code":"L0101","size":253,"enrolment":0,"times":[{"day":"MONDAY","start":43200,"end":46800,"duration":3600,"location":"PB B150"}],"instructors":["M Emami"]},{"code":"P0101","size":100,"enrolment":0,"times":[{"day":"MONDAY","start":46800,"end":64800,"duration":18000,"location":"SF 4003"},{"day":"MONDAY","start":46800,"end":64800,"duration":18000,"location":"SF 4102"},{"day":"MONDAY","start":46800,"end":64800,"duration":18000,"location":"SF 4103"},{"day":"FRIDAY","start":50400,"end":64800,"duration":14400,"location":"SF 4003"},{"day":"FRIDAY","start":50400,"end":64800,"duration":14400,"location":"SF 4102"},{"day":"FRIDAY","start":50400,"end":64800,"duration":14400,"location":"SF 4103"}],"instructors":[]},{"code":"P0102","size":100,"enrolment":0,"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":46800,"end":64800,"duration":18000,"location":"SF 4102"},{"day":"TUESDAY","start":46800,"end":64800,"duration":18000,"location":"SF 4003"},{"day":"TUESDAY","start":46800,"end":64800,"duration":18000,"location":"SF 4103"},{"day":"FRIDAY","start":50400,"end":64800,"duration":14400,"location":"SF 4102"},{"day":"FRIDAY","start":50400,"end":64800,"duration":14400,"location":"SF 4003"},{"day":"FRIDAY","start":50400,"end":64800,"duration":14400,"location":"SF 4103"}],"instructors":[]},{"code":"P0103","size":100,"enrolment":0,"times":[{"day":"FRIDAY","start":50400,"end":64800,"duration":14400,"location":"SF 4103"},{"day":"FRIDAY","start":50400,"end":64800,"duration":14400,"location":"SF 4003"},{"day":"FRIDAY","start":50400,"end":64800,"duration":14400,"location":"SF 4102"},{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":46800,"end":64800,"duration":18000,"location":"SF 4103"},{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":46800,"end":64800,"duration":18000,"location":"SF 4102"},{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":46800,"end":64800,"duration":18000,"location":"SF 4003"}],"instructors":[]}],"breadths":[]},{"id":"AER210H1F20169","code":"AER210H1F","name":"Vector Calculus & Fluid Mechanics","description":"The first part of this course covers multiple integrals and vector calculus.

On earth, such reactions could form the basis of an essentially inexhaustible energy resource. In order for the fusion reactions to proceed at a rate suitable for the generation of electricity, the fuels (usually hydrogen) must be heated to temperatures near 100 million Kelvin. At these temperatures, the fuel will exist in the plasma state. This course will cover: (i) the basic physics of fusion, including reaction cross-sections, particle energy distributions, Lawson criterion and radiation balance, (ii) plasma properties including plasma waves, plasma transport, heating and stability, and (iii) fusion plasma confinement methods (magnetic and inertial). Topics will be related to current experimental research in the field.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Division of Engineering Science","prerequisites":"","exclusions":"","level":500,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2016 Fall","meeting_sections":[{"code":"L0101","size":25,"enrolment":0,"times":[{"day":"THURSDAY","start":54000,"end":57600,"duration":3600,"location":"BA 1230"},{"day":"TUESDAY","start":57600,"end":64800,"duration":7200,"location":"BA 1230"}],"instructors":["J Davis"]},{"code":"T0101","size":25,"enrolment":0,"times":[{"day":"THURSDAY","start":50400,"end":54000,"duration":3600,"location":"BA 1230"}],"instructors":["J Davis"]}],"breadths":[]},{"id":"AER510H1S20171","code":"AER510H1S","name":"Aerospace Propulsion","description":"Scope and history of jet and rocket propulsion; fundamentals of air-breathing and rocket propulsion; fluid mechanics and thermodynamics of propulsion including boundary layer mechanics and combustion; principles of aircraft jet engines, engine components and performance; principles of rocket propulsion, rocket performance, and chemical rockets; environmental impact of aircraft jet engines.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Division of Engineering Science","prerequisites":"AER310H1","exclusions":"","level":500,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2017 Winter","meeting_sections":[{"code":"T0101","size":35,"enrolment":0,"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":46800,"end":50400,"duration":3600,"location":"GB 244"}],"instructors":[]},{"code":"L0101","size":35,"enrolment":0,"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":43200,"end":46800,"duration":3600,"location":"GB 244"},{"day":"THURSDAY","start":32400,"end":39600,"duration":7200,"location":"GB 244"}],"instructors":["A Steinberg"]}],"breadths":[]},{"id":"AER521H1S20171","code":"AER521H1S","name":"Mobile Robotics and Perception","description":"The course addresses fundamentals of mobile robotics and sensor-based perception for applications such as space exploration, search and rescue, mining, self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, etc.  Topics include sensors and their principles, state estimation, computer vision, control architectures, localization, mapping, planning, path tracking, and software frameworks.  Laboratories will be conducted using both simulations and hardware kits.\r\nNote: ROB310 will be a required prerequisite for AER521 in 2018-19.","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","department":"Division of Engineering Science","prerequisites":"AER372H1","exclusions":"","level":500,"campus":"UTSG","term":"2017 Winter","meeting_sections":[{"code":"T0101","size":50,"enrolment":0,"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":46800,"end":50400,"duration":3600,"location":"HA 401"}],"instructors":["T Barfoot"]},{"code":"P0101","size":50,"enrolment":0,"times":[{"day":"TUESDAY","start":32400,"end":43200,"duration":10800,"location":"SF 4102"}],"instructors":["T Barfoot"]},{"code":"L0101","size":50,"enrolment":0,"times":[{"day":"WEDNESDAY","start":43200,"end":46800,"duration":3600,"location":"HA 401"},{"day":"MONDAY","start":43200,"end":50400,"duration":7200,"location":"RS 310"}],"instructors":["T Barfoot"]}],"breadths":[]},{"id":"AER525H1F20169","code":"AER525H1F","name":"Robotics","description":"The course addresses fundamentals of analytical robotics as well as design and control of industrial robots and their instrumentation.
